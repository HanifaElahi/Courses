    "In the crossover step, the function randomly selects pairs of parents from the selected population and performs crossover with a probability specified by the crossover_prob parameter. The method of crossover is determined by the crossover_method parameter, which can be set to \"uniform\", \"one-point\", or \"multi-parent\".\n",
    "\n",
    "If uniform crossover is selected, the function performs uniform crossover on the parents to generate two offspring. If one-point crossover is selected, the function performs one-point crossover on the parents to generate two offspring. If multi-parent crossover is selected, the function performs multi-parent crossover on the parents to generate two offspring. The offspring are added to the offspring population.\n",

    "In the mutation step, the function applies mutation to the offspring population with a probability specified by the mutation_prob parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "After mutation, the function evaluates the fitness of the mutated population. The fitness of each individual in the population is determined by the fitness function, which takes the chromosome and knapsack problem instance as input and returns the fitness value.\n",

    "The function then selects a new population from the mutated population based on the fitness values. The new population consists of the pop_size individuals with the highest fitness values.\n",

The function adds this best solution to the list of best solutions obtained in all runs.\n",

    "Finally, the function calculates and returns the average of the best-of-run solutions obtained in the 30 independent runs."
