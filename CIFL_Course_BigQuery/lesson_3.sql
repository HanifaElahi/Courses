-- The basic structure of an ORDER BY parameter is:
-- ORDER BY columnname direction (either asc for ascending or desc for descending)

-- Note: 
-- If you donâ€™t truly need to order results in a certain way, then you can leave out the ORDER BY - 
-- it can be an unnecessary drain on performance when running large queries
