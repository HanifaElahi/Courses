# H2O Clients

These clients allow you to connect to and interact with H2O

# H2O Flow

H2O Flow is a Web based (GUI) user interface. It allows users to interactively run their H2O machine learning workflows and iteratively improve them. It combines code execution, text, mathematics, plots, and rich media in a single document.

# R Client
R users can use H2O-R library which internally uses H2O REST API calls to connect to H2O (Server) and allows users to run their H2O workflow via R. 

# Python Client
Python users can connect to H2O using the H2O Python pacakge that internally uses H2O REST API calls to connect to H2O (Server) and allows users to run their H2O workflow via Python.

# Sklearn Support
Most H2O estimators available in the H2O-Python client can also be used in the standard sklearn API. The h2o.sklearn module provides a collection of wrappers auto-generated on top of the original estimators and transformers, as well as on top of H2OAutoML.
