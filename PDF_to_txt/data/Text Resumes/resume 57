PERSONAL PROJECTS
Lineaments Mapping of a Region in Pakistan using
Optical and SAR Remote Sensing Data

The project studies the application of satellite remote sensing to
geological studies, using Sentinel 1 and Sentinel 2 satellite imagery
for the mapping of lineaments of the Potohar Plateau. Methods
such as optical color composites, image ﬁltering and edge
detection, and PCA (Principal Components Analysis) were applied
on the pre-processed satellite imagery to detect and identify
lineaments.

A Web Map visualization of Zika Virus in the United
States of America from 2015 to 2019

With the help of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, dot proportional web
maps using SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) document picture of a
mosquito were built. Using the leaﬂet library base map was
uploaded and a time slider functions for time ranging web maps.
The geological boundaries of the states of USA were stored in a
GeoJSON ﬁle.

Visualizing Aerosol data of Islamabad using python

The aerosol data was in NetCDF format which was then uploaded
and visualized in GUI with the help of Python libraries.

Created a Spatial database for an NGO "UMEED" using
PostgreSQL

UMEED has a large network of schools for which it provides free
