PROJECTS   

LANE DETECTION SYSTEM FOR AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES:   

This is my Final Year Project where we have designed a lane detection algorithm using OpenCV and Python 
and implemented that algorithm in Carla Simulator. This system can robustly detect lanes and can be 
integrated with other modules to create a functional self-driving car.   

AN ARITIFICIALLY INTELLIGENT CHATBOT USING DIALOGFLOW:   

My Companion is an android app which is a person’s secret keeper or friend. This chatbot is created by 
using Google’s machine learning technology DialogFlow. The chatbot uses Natural Language Processing 
to communicate with the user and the user can have friendly conversations with the chatbot.  

PREDICTING MOVIE RATINGS USING DATA SCIENCE:   

A  Python  and  Machine  Learning  project  which  estimates  the  ratings  of  movies  based  on  their  other 
attributes by using Logistic Regression algorithm.    

A SOCIAL NETWORKING WEBAPP:   

A web application developed with Html, Css and Php that contains a few functions similar to Facebook 
etc. such as creating accounts, chatting, uploading status etc.
